# cdd-java
This project aims to make Contract-Driven Development efficient and easy, simplifying the process and reducing the overheads for developing tests. In particuler, the project has the following aims:
<ol>
  <li>To make it really easy and efficient to specify component contracts by annotating interfaces methods with pre-conditions, post-conditions and invariance constraints using a Java like syntax. </li>
  <li>To be able to generate test interceptors which can be used 
    <ul> 
      <li>for unit testing</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<h3>Upgrading interfaces to component contracts</h3>
<h4>The <i>Java Based Constrint Language (JBCL)</h4>
  

The project provides 
  - contract annotations 
  - contract validating interceptors used in contract-driven development (CDD) for unit testing, integration testing, operational testing and service-provider oversight.
